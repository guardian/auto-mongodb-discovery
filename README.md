Auto-discover your MongoDB instances in AWS and generate connection configuration during run-time.

Reserving private IP addresses in an AWS VPC is tricky and relying on a privately hosted Route 53 is a bit of a pain. By using instance tags we can instead auto-discover which hosts that are designated to run MongoDB and generate the configuration using that.
